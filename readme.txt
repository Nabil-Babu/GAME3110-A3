--Match Making Server Procedure--
The Match Making server makes a list of players with base 200 points of your skill level using lambda functions that are accessing a DynamoDB. The base is then adjusted by (0.5 * RequestingPlayerLoses * 100). The server shrinks the list down to 2 or less people closest to your skill level. This list is return to the client making the request. Player who made the request is stored in the log along with any matched players who are similar in skill to the player making the request. It is assumed any players retrieved from the database are in lobby.  

--Client Simulation Procedure--
The client runs the game simulation a set user defined amount of times. A random player is requested from the Database using Lambda API endpoints. The randomly picked player requests a match from the Matching making server by attempting a connection at the servers address. The server returns at most 2 players that are similar in skill level to simulate a match and a winner is randomly chosen. The winner of the match has there skill increased by (losersSkillTotal/totalPlayersSkill) * maxSkillPool) where maxSkillPool is equal to 100 points * max players allowed in a match(3). This makes sure if a lower skilled player wins they get significant points added to their level.
