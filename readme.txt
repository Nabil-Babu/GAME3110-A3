The Match Making server makes a list of players within 200 points of your skill level. The server shrinks the list down to 2 people closest to your level. The winner of the match has there skill increase by (losersSkillTotal/totalPlayersSkill) * maxSkillPool) where maxSkillPool is equal to 100 points for every player in the match. This makes sure if a lower skilled player wins they get significant points added to their level.
